        These statistics are for all studies compiled in the IARC database (downloadable dataset of somatic
        mutations).
        Some of these data are not included in the searchable data because they have been identified as poor quality
        data (such studies are annotated as 'Exclude' and we recommended to exclude them from meta-analyses).
        <br/> <br/>
        * Data may be deleted if (1) they correspond to duplicate entries or (2) errors.
        Publication of the same set of samples in different papers by the same authors is a serious problem that has
        led to duplicates entries
        in the database in the past. We now perform systematic searches of the database under the authorâ€™s name to
        identify earlier entries that may correspond
        to the same dataset. We have also extensively reviewed the entire dataset in order to find and eliminate
        these duplicates. However, despite these efforts,
        some duplicates may remain in the database and their identification is an ongoing task.<br>
        ** Papers edited in PubMed at the indicated dates were searched with selected keywords and reviewed to
        extract relevant data.<br>
        *** The dataset of somatic variants has not been updated. <br/>
        **** The update only include a selection of papers (see <a href="about#database-dev-div">database
        developments</a>).
